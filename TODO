* Revisit locking, maybe specify points for every shape where you could lock connectors to.
* Need to revisit Items inheritance approach, it is now hard to add shared functions to "subclasses"
* Add some UI
* Improve performance of rendering an item. Especially - sorting the points, for now it is freaking slow
* Design better 'rect-line'
* Change how the selection looks for a line - it should just have 2 dots for moving it around (start and end)
* Add possibility to group/ungroup items
* Add grid
* Add guides
* Add a way to change z-indexes of items
* Add copying/pasting
* Add a way to flattenize and copy to clipboard
* Add nice helpers showing the origin/dimensions of an item when you resize/move it around
* Find a way how to design UI for Undo Tree
