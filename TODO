* Add way to specify text alignment (horizontal and vertical)
* Add possibility to group/ungroup items
* Add guides
* Add nice helpers showing the origin/dimensions of an item when you resize/move it around
* Find a way how to design UI for Undo Tree
* Add fills
* Make sure we always show resize cursors (assign classes to .project)
* Add a way to align items relatively to each other
* Draw straight/square items with 'Shift'
* Check if I could publish it as a Google Chrome app.
* Add some visual confirmation when you reach some outlet by a connector
* Refactor drawer.js
* It seems like sometimes cache is not updated before rendering - mispositioned items. Need to figure out why and fix
* Maybe custom colorize the items?
* Add comments here and there
* Add autoadjusting of items' size to the inner text size
* Add "undo previews" - when you hover over the undo button, you will see a preview what gonna happen when you click undo
* Save user preferences (maybe in local storage?)
* Add export/import to/from a file
* Autodestroy empty text items
* Think how would it be possible to implement collaboration
  - How to handle undo's? Keep a separate one for every user? Also, need to add 'direction' of change, is this a new change or 'undo'?
  - How to distinguish who made what change? Prob generate uuid, and check if the change is made not by current uuid
  - Keep n 'currents' for every user, and n 'undo' stacks
  - Would be nice to show typing text alive - how?
  - If send updates to Firebase while drawing/resizing, we could spam it...
    Need to check how quickly we can do that
